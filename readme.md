First simple project: 
  Allow me to use nvim to edit text from clipboard. Zero dependencies and vim implementation from scratch. No CLI UI as well

Idea
  Taking inspiration from workflowy and nvim. Having a tree-like structure of notes with different layout and possibility to add images\links\integrations(youtube). Some extra features: tags, search, focus.  
  Also I want a single place to organize my thoughts, music, videos, links, etc.

Scope
  Tree-like structure for notes (aka workflowy)
  Layout of the app (aka flexbox in C++)
