I want notes better than vim. Just notes, no links, code, music, whatever. Just a sleek way to work on my notes.

Note editor and fuck it v4
  Parse nested items in a file and show them in a tree 
  Ability to collapse certain areas 


Areas to focus
  - Notes editor
  - Code editor
  - Music player (aka better youtube)


Examples I have
  - Youtube API player in a webpage (just html\js)
  - WebView2 simple webpage from C win32 
  - ASM compiling and printing hello world
  - Calling ASM function from the C

    Some key terms: 
      misinformation - unintentionally incorrect information
      disinformation - intentionally incorrect information
      hate speech and propaganda have no definitions
  Part 2 Facts and Fact checking
    Ask yourself three questions 
      Who is behind this information 
      What is the evidence of their claims
      What other sources say about their claims
    They show a GREAT example of showing where is the horizon using two points. 
    They claim
     - Reading is a usefull skill - factual claim
     - Reading X will make you a great person - opinion claim
