    i I A
    I can't use di or ci where i is item, since it break diw or cib. Thus i will use dn cn where n is node

      I need a win32 event on a window before opening a ShellExecute, otherwise I will recieve WM_CHAR on a call
    Command Buffer /c
      Allows to have . (repeat last command)
      Allows to have actions consisting from multiple keys and combinators (ctrl, alt, win)
  Things to think about /c
    Multiple cursors
    Two hand navigation /c
      right hand makes regular hjkl motions
      left hand makes structural motions (go to parent, sibling, etc)
    Cursor history
    Complex motions like dw ci etc
    Unicode /c
      DrawTextW expects the length of the string to be in codepoints, not actual characters
      What I need to order to support Unicode with UTF-16 encoding
        All text as c16
        Cursor position is set it characters, not bytes or codepoints

  Intro
    - Joke: two fish swim iin the ocean. WAlk to a old fish, old fish asks "how the ocea?". They swim further without the response. Then one fish asks another "what's ocean"
    Author says he is not the wise fish. In addition he mentions that he is skeptical of any fish claiming to be wise here.
    Internet is young and we are still figuring it out how to use it. 
    Some key terms: 
      misinformation - unintentionally incorrect information
      disinformation - intentionally incorrect information
      hate speech and propaganda have no definitions
  Part 2 Facts and Fact checking
    Ask yourself three questions 
      Who is behind this information 
      What is the evidence of their claims
      What other sources say about their claims
    They show a GREAT example of showing where is the horizon using two points. 
    They claim
      - Reading is a usefull skill - factual claim
      - Reading X will make you a great person - opinion claim
